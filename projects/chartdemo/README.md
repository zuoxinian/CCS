# Gain better insights with additional intrinsic dimensions and normative brain charts 
## a) The two groups of sample points distinguished by different colors are non-separable on the 2-dimensional plane with the two features as axes. 
## b) When the sample size increases, the respective distribution areas of the two groups appear clearer but still overlap. 
## c) With age as the third dimension, the two groups are effectively separated, and their different distribution patterns around the normative trajectory (solid line) of the two features are revealed. 
## d) Increasing the sample size helps to more clearly obtain the different distribution patterns of the groups. 
## e&f) By obtaining normative features with reference to the normative trajectory, the hidden distinction between the two groups is revealed on the 2-dimensional plane with the two normative axes, which is clear even with a small sample size as in panel e. 

Animations that show distributions of samples in panels c, d and processes of transforming raw feature scores into normative feature scores are provided here.
